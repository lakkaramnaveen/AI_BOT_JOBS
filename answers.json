Additionally, my internship focused on machine learning, where I fine-tuned pre-trained models and developed custom algorithms, aligns well with your preference for candidates experienced in ML and chatbot development.\n\nI am particularly drawn to SOCOTEC\u2019s holistic approach to sustainability and energy efficiency, as these values resonate with my passion for innovative technology solutions.

With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and over two years of experience in software development, I am eager to contribute to Cedar's vision of making healthcare more affordable and accessible through innovative technology.\n\nIn my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at Capgemini, I successfully drove the creation of over 15 application reports and collaborated with agile teams to enhance client experiences. My expertise in Java and Spring frameworks allowed me to optimize backend services, which directly aligns with Cedar's focus on improving patient engagement and payment systems. Additionally, my experience in migrating legacy code to modern technology stacks, including AWS and React.js, has equipped me with the skills necessary to develop and maintain features that enhance payment processing and patient interactions.\n\nI am particularly drawn to Cedar's commitment to inclusivity and its ambitious goal of serving millions of Americans by 2025. I believe my technical skills, coupled with my passion for improving user experiences in healthcare, make me a strong fit for this role. I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Cedar's mission and help create a smoother patient billing experience."
